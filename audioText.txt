A walk in March

okay, so.
i'm walking along the beach here in san quito and i'm testing the sound .quality.
to see whether or not.
the wind makes it unworkable.
but on my left there's the water's edge.
and in the distance.
the air was so tiny.
from a distance.
shipyards with their cranes and their warehouses.
and if i look forward.
i'm coming to.
the shakespeare grove.
peer extension.
which is about to be renovated.
and on the right hand side.
we have the running track.

an ,edge ,water towers.
and in front of me i can .see.
on the ,right.
the scenic railway and on the left.
the palais theater.
and to my extreme left i'm looking down the beach of santiago.
all ,the ,way down.
to.
the ,spirits ,of ,tasmania.


as i continue down the laneway.
i see cars pulling out.
after work i imagine on the lefthand side now is a beautiful painted corrugated iron fence in a deep.
deep.
terracotta.
reflected on the other side.
they've ,chosen.
more of ,a steel gray.
roller doors one after the other some with gabled roofs.
others.
just simple brick constructions.
a beautiful big tree on the right hand side.
on the left hand side more cars and little flats old flats new flats.
