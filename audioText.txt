A walk in April, Melbourne

okay ,so.
i'm walking along the beach here in san quito and i'm testing the sound .quality.
to see whether or .not.
the ,wind ,makes ,it ,unworkable.
but on my left there's the water's edge.
and in the distance.
the air was so .tiny.
from a distance.
shipyards with their cranes and ,their warehouses.
and if i look forward.
i'm ,coming to.
the shakespeare grove.
peer extension.
which is about to be renovated.
and on the right hand side.
we have the running track.
an ,edge ,water towers.
and in front of me i can .see.
on the ,right.
the scenic railway and on the left.
the palais theater.
and to my extreme left i'm looking down the beach of santiago.
all ,the ,way down.
to.
the ,spirits ,of ,tasmania.
